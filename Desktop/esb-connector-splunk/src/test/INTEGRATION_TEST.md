        iii)   On the Add new page, fill out the [properties](http://dev.splunk.com/view/webframework-developapps/SP-CAAAEUC) of the new app.
        iv)    Click Save.
4.Download EI 6.4.0  by navigating to the following [URL](http://wso2.com/products/enterprise-service-bus/#).

5.The EI should be configured as below;
       
        i)  Please make sure that the below mentioned Axis configurations are enabled (/repository/conf/axis2/axis2.xml).
         <parameter name="HostnameVerifier">AllowAll</parameter>
        ii)Open a command line terminal and execute the following command from "$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth" to import the certificate to  client-truststore.jks:
                        "keytool -importcert -file server.pem -keystore {EI_HOME}/repository/resources/security/client-truststore.jks -alias splunk"
        iii) Deploy relevant patches, if applicable.

6.Compress modified EI as wso2ei-6.4.0.zip and copy that zip file in to location `<CONNECTOR_HOME>/repository/`.

7.Follow the below mentioned steps for adding valid certificate to access Splunk API over https

        i) Copy the certificate "server.pem" by navigating to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth and place the certificate file in following location.
        "{SPLUNK_CONNECTOR_HOME}/src/repository"
        ii)Open a command line terminal and execute the following command from "$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth" to import the certificate to  client-truststore.jks and wso2carbon.jks:
            "keytool -importcert -file server.pem -keystore {SPLUNK_CONNECTOR_HOME}/src/test/resources/keystores/products/client-truststore.jks -alias splunk" and "keytool -importcert -file server.pem -keystore {SPLUNK_CONNECTOR_HOME}/src/test/resources/keystores/products/wso2carbon.jks -alias splunk"

8.Update the 'esb-connector-splunk.properties' file at the location "{SPLUNK_CONNECTOR_HOME}/repository" as below

        i)    username                  -		Use the username, step 2->(iii)
        ii)   password                  -		Use the password, step 2->(iii)
